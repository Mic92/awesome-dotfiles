Idea
----
Inspired by anrxc I made my own icon set for awesome wm.
I borrowed most of icons from the ubuntu mono light icons 
and integrate them into awesome's default theme. 

How to use
----------
I distribute all files in the Scalable Vector Graphics format (svg).
In order to convert them to png use the Makefile:
 make all
This requires "convert" from the imagemagick.
If your target is a different awesome theme, you can easily adapt 
the color in one flush by modifiyng the example in Makefile.

Contribution
------------
Improvements or extension of my set are welcome! 
Send me an email or a pull request in github.
