awesome config
==============

Here is my personal configuration of awesome.
Currently I use awesome v3.4.12 (Starlight)

with the following modules:

* cal

* shifty

* vicious

* lognotify -> depends on inotify (read lognotifiy's Readme)

* mpd -> depends on luasocket

* lfs (only for my run once function)

* iwlist
