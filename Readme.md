awesome config
==============

Here is my personal configuration of awesome.
Currently I use awesome v3.4.12 (Starlight)

with the following modules:


* shifty

* vicious

* lognotify -> depends on inotify (read lognotifiy's Readme)

* in utils repository:
    - iwlist (wrapper around iwlist to display wifi-networks)
    - wimpd (widget for mpd, depends on luasocket)
    - cal (calendar popup)
