awesome config
==============

Here is my personal configuration of awesome.
Currently I use awesome v3.5.4 (Brown Paper Bag)

with the following modules:

* [tyrannical](https://github.com/Elv13/tyrannical)
  * dynamic tagging configuration system
* [vicious](https://github.com/Mic92/vicious)
  * modular widget library

Personally I build awesome with luajit ([awesome-luajit-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/awesome-luajit-git/) in AUR, if you are on archlinux)

* [lognotify](https://github.com/Mic92/lognotify) -> depends on inotify and luasocket (read the Readme of lognotify)

* in [utils](https://github.com/Mic92/utils) repository:
    - iwlist (wrapper around iwlist to display wifi-networks)
    - wimpd (widget for mpd, depends on luasocket)
    - cal (calendar popup)
